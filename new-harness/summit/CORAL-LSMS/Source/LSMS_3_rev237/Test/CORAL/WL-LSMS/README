WL-LSMS benchmark: Fixed system size varrying number of Wang-Landau walkers (wl-lsms)

This directory contains the input for wl-lsms runs.
The input files are identical for all sizes as only the number of WL walkers changes.
The physical system is a 1024 atom bcc iron system with 113 atoms in the local interaction zone.

wl-lsms requires an additional MPI rank for the WL master. I.e. if each LSMS instance uses
K MPI ranks the total number of ranks required is 1+K*N.
with N walkers and M WL steps/walker use the following command:

mpirun -np 1+K*N $(LSMS_DIRECTORY)/bin/wl-lsms -i i_lsms -mode 1d -size_lsms 1024 -num_lsms N -num_steps N*M

i.e for 15 walkers and 20 steps/walker and 32 MPI ranks/walker:

mpirun -np 481 wl-lsms -i i_lsms -mode 1d -size_lsms 1024 -num_lsms 15 -num_steps 300

The figure of merit is:

<walltime>*<number of nodes (K*N)>/<total number of steps (N*M)>

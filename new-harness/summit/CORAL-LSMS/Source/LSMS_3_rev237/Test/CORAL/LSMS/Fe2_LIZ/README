LSMS Fe2_LIZ benchmark: fixed numer of atoms (2) varrying size of matrix to invert (LIZ)

These are input files to test the single node performance of LSMS (without the WL part).
All inputs are for a two atom system with increasing size of the local interaction zone (LIZ).
the input files i_lsms_NNN are for NNN atoms in the LIZ.
(The possible values of NNN are determined by the crystal geometry, hence the set of inputs provided.)
The main computational effort in LSMS calculations arrises usually from finding a 2*(lmax+1)^2 sub-block of the inverse of a general (non-Hermitian) double complex matrix of rank 2*(lmax+1)^2 * nLIZ.
lmax is typically 3, but it can be any small integer (e.g. 2,3,4,5).

The testcases provided in this directory can be run using the lsms executable:

$(LSMS_DIRECTORY)/bin/lsms i_lsms_NNN

i_lsms is identical to i_lsms_113, the rLIZ=12.5 case used in the WL-LSMS tests.

The figure of merit is:

<walltime> / <NNN^3>

It might be expected that not all problem size can fit into the memory:
The size of the matrix is 16 * (32 * NNN)^2 bytes (16 = size of complex<double>)
The minimal requirement is the possibility to run the i_lsms_113 case required for
the wl-lsms tests.

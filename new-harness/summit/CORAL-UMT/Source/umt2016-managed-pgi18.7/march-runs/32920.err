A process has executed an operation involving a call to the
"fork()" system call to create a child process.  Open MPI is currently
operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that

A process has executed an operation involving a call to the
"fork()" system call to create a child process.  Open MPI is currently
operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that
create child processes) is strongly discouraged.

The process that invoked fork was:

  Local host:          [[32875,201],82] (PID 94921)

If you are *absolutely sure* that your application will successfully

operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that

operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that
create child processes) is strongly discouraged.

The process that invoked fork was:

If you are *absolutely sure* that your application will successfully

operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that
create child processes) is strongly discouraged.

WARNING: There are more than one active ports on host 'a07n17', but the
default subnet GID prefix was detected on more than one of these
ports.  If these ports are connected to different physical IB
networks, this configuration will fail in Open MPI.  This version of
Open MPI requires that every physically separate IB subnet that is
used between connected MPI processes must have different subnet ID
values.

Please see this FAQ entry for more details:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ofa-default-subnet-gid

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_default_gid_prefix to 0.

A process has executed an operation involving a call to the
"fork()" system call to create a child process.  Open MPI is currently
operating in a condition that could result in memory corruption or
other system errors; your job may hang, crash, or produce silent
data corruption.  The use of fork() (or system() or other calls that
create child processes) is strongly discouraged.

The process that invoked fork was:

  Local host:          [[32875,201],142] (PID 92791)

If you are *absolutely sure* that your application will successfully
and correctly survive a call to fork(), you may disable this warning
by setting the mpi_warn_on_fork MCA parameter to 0.

GUPS benchmark test
  This benchmark executes random access bandwidth tests using direct load stores to local and remote memory.
  The benchmark launches a number of CTAs and each CTA will update memory as specified as many times as possible in the given time.
  Each CTA can touch memory in any other GPU including itself depending on the GPU indexing algorithm
  After completion the total aggregate bandwidth produced from each GPU is computed and output

Usage:
  -h: print this help screen
  -b X: buffer size in bytes per GPU
  -u X: the unroll size of the kernel (1, 2, 4, or 8)
  -w X: the word size for the kernel (4, 8, or 16)
  -s X: the number of bytes in an update
  -c X: the cta size
  -C X: the number of CTAs per edge
  -W X: the warmup time in seconds
  -R X: the test runtime in seconds
  -d X: the number of devices to allocate the table over
  -e X: the umber of GPUs produceing random access requests
  -t X: the test type.  Can be R, W, M, A, N. (Read, Write, Modify, Atomic, None).
  -m X: the indexing algorithm.  L: Linear indexing, R: Random indexing
  -g X: the GPU indexing algorithm.  Can be S, O, A.  (Self, Other, Any).
         Self:  Each GPU only writes to its own local memory.
         Other: Each GPU only writes to remote memory.
         Any:  Each GPU can write to any memory (local or remote).
